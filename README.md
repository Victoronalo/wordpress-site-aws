Project-WordPress Site on AWS
Objective-
-First of all I created  VPC with a public and private subnet with CDIR range of 10.0.0.0/16 called wordpress.
-I proceeded to create a public subnet and a private subnet in different in two AZs. 
-I then created an internet gateway named IGW-Wordpress.
-I proceeded to create an EC2 instance named WordPress-instance
-I then went register a domain name on Route 53
-Autoscaling was also added to make the website highly available.
-For the Alb security group port  80 and 443 was used, source=0.0.0.0/0
-SSH security group port=22, source my IP address
-Webserver security group port=80 and 443 and 22, source=ssh security group
-Database security group port=3306, source=webserver security group
-EFS security group port=2049 and 22, source=SSH security group
-Proceeded to DNS settings and added two custom A records of the domain name.
-I ssh to connect the instance.
-I continued by running the command “sudo apt update”
-Natgateway was created and attached
-I also created a MYSQL RDS database and configured it.
-I mounted EFS on the instance
-I also ran the command “sudo apt upgrade”
-Went ahead to run “sudo apt install nginx mariadb-server php-fpm php-mysql”
-To install word press, I CD to /var/www directory.
-Furthermore ls into the /var/www to get the html folder
-To get wordpress I used the command “sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
-To extend it to wordpress I used the command “sudo tar –xzvf latest.tar.gz”
-I did change of ownership using command “sudo chown –R www-data:www-data wordpress 
-Also I used the command “sudo find wordpress/ -type d –exec chmod 755
-I proceeded to use the command “sudo mysql –u root –p
-I applied privileges with the command “flush privileges”
-Furthermore to look at our web server, I cd into /etc/nginx/
-I proceeded to cd sites-available/
-Then I ran “sudo vim wordpress.conf
-I added the code for the webserver in the editor
-I proceeded to configure the database with password and email.
-Connected the database to the webserver
-I ran “sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
-Ran “sudo snap install –classic certbot
-I used certbot to get the ssh certificate.
-This project is very challenging in the aspect of paying for different services.
-But I was able to find a way around it.
-I have learnt a lot from this project.
